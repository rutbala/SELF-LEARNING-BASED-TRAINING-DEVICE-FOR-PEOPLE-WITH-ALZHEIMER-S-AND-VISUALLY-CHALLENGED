Introduction:-

Alzheimer's disease frequently exhibits symptoms of visual impairment (AD). Visual interventions have the potential to help AD patients operate better, according to recent studies. Determining the profile of visual abnormalities in AD and potential processes driving these deficits are therefore necessary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a long-term, irreversible brain disorder that gradually impairs one's ability to think and remember things. Alzheimer's disease is one of the most frequent causes of dementia. Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning, which includes thinking, remembering, and reasoning, as well as behavioral ability to the point where it affects day-to-day activities. In the medical industry, image processing is frequently used to identify disorders and support clinicians' observation-based decision-making. The objective of the study is to detect Alzheimer's disease as early as possible, allowing patients to receive treatment before their brains undergo irreversible changes. To process the brain's Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), we suggest the image processing method. We propose a camera-based detection system that enables individuals with vision problems or Alzheimer's disease to read written labels or books, recognise the names of things in real-time, and recognise the names of well-known individuals using face identification and sign languages. To read the texts from books, we convert the image to text using an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) approach. after text has been created from the images. By using machine learning, we will be able to convert sign language, recognised faces, and live objects into text. The projected output will be converted to audio using the Text to Speech API.

Proposed System;-

1. FAMILY FACIAL RECOGNITION- It involves two steps that is enrollment and testing. These have three common steps: Face acquisition, pre processing, and feature extraction. The only extra step in enrollment is that after the three pieces of information are processed, they are collected as a database. The enrollment and testing together are made as classifiers, in which we have two parts that are once after the patient recognizes the face of the family member and if it is matching with the database, we get an output of “Yes” which means it is matched but if it is not matched then we get an output of “No” that is not matched. This facial recognition recognizes the family member’s face and captures the facial identity and stores the data and helps the Alzheimer’s patient by wearing this camera to help them recognize the family member.

2. OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION- On wearing the camera, the first step involved is Image Acquisition i.e., the act of obtaining an image from a source. After obtaining the image then the image is pre processed and after that, the features are extracted from the image. The extracted image is then translated to text as the following stage, and the text is then presented as the last step. This method helps Alzheimer’s to identify objects and read labels on books or objects.

3. REAL-TIME OBJECT DETECTION- On wearing the camera, the first step involved is Image Acquisition i.e., the act of obtaining an image from a source. After obtaining the image then the image is pre-processed and after that, the features are extracted from the image. The next step is that all the database is collected and stored and it checks if the object is recognized and matched. The last step is that the output is displayed, whether the recognized object is matched and found in the database or not. This method helps Alzheimer’s patients to recognize real-time objects like balls, cars, glasses, etc. The output is in the form of text converted to Audio.

4. SIGN TO SPEECH USING TENSOR FLOW AND KERAS PRE-TRAINED MODEL- On wearing the camera, the first step involved is Image Acquisition i.e., the act of obtaining an image from a source. After obtaining the image then the image is pre-processed and after that, the features are extracted from the image. The next step is that all the database is collected and stored. After which the predicted signs are recognized and checked if it is matched with the database and the output is displayed. This helps Alzheimer’s patients to identify sign languages and it converts them to text and finally to audio for the patients.
