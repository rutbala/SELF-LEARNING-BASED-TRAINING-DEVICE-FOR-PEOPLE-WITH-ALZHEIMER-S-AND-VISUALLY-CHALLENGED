# SELF-LEARNING-BASED-TRAINING-DEVICE-FOR-PEOPLE-WITH-ALZHEIMER-S-AND-VISUALLY-CHALLENGED

Introduction:-

Alzheimer's disease (AD) often presents with visual impairments, significantly impacting patients' daily functioning. Recent studies suggest that visual interventions could enhance the quality of life for AD patients. To detect AD early and mitigate irreversible brain changes, we propose an AI-driven image processing approach. Our system processes brain MRI scans using advanced image processing techniques to aid early detection. Additionally, we introduce a camera-based detection system leveraging machine learning and AI to assist AD patients with visual challenges. This system uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to convert text from images, enabling patients to read books and labels. Machine learning models further translate sign language, recognize faces, and identify objects in real-time, converting these into text. The final output is synthesized into audio using a Text to Speech API, enhancing accessibility and communication for individuals with Alzheimer's disease.

Proposed System;-

1. FAMILY FACIAL RECOGNITION- The process involves enrollment and testing phases, both using face acquisition, preprocessing, and feature extraction. In enrollment, features are stored in a database. During testing, an AI-powered classifier checks for matches. If a match is found, it outputs “Yes”; if not, “No.” This ML-driven facial recognition system helps Alzheimer's patients recognize family members by wearing a camera that identifies familiar faces in real-time.

2. OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION-  the system captures an image (Image Acquisition), preprocesses it, and extracts features using AI techniques. These features are then processed by machine learning algorithms to convert the image into text, which is then presented or spoken. This AI-driven approach helps Alzheimer's patients identify objects and read labels.

3. REAL-TIME OBJECT DETECTION- Upon wearing the camera, Image Acquisition captures the scene, followed by AI-driven preprocessing and feature extraction. The features are compared against a machine learning database to recognize objects like cars or glasses. The system uses NLP and text-to-speech to convert the recognized objects into audio, aiding Alzheimer's patients in real-time object identification.

4. SIGN TO SPEECH USING TENSOR FLOW AND KERAS PRE-TRAINED MODEL-  the first step is Image Acquisition to capture an image. The image is then pre-processed, and features are extracted. The system checks the extracted features against a machine learning database to recognize and match sign languages. The output is converted from text to audio, assisting Alzheimer’s patients in understanding sign languages.
